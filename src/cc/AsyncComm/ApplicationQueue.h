  /**
   * Application queue.  
   * Helper class for use by server applications that are driven by messages
   * received over the network.  This class can be used in conjunction with the
   * ApplicationHandler class to implement an incoming request queue.  Worker
   * threads pull handlers (requests) off the queue and carry them out.  The
   * following features are supported:
   *
   * <b>Groups</b>
   *
   * Because a set of worker threads pull requests from the queue and carry
   * them out independently, it is possible for requests to get executed out
   * of order relative to the order in which they arrived in the queue.  This
   * can cause problems for certain request sequences such as appending data
   * to a file in the DfsBroker, or fetching scanner results from a scanner
   * using multiple readahead requests.  <i>Groups</i> are a way to give
   * applications the ability to serialize a set of requests.  Each request
   * has a <i>group ID</i> that is returned by 
   * the ApplicationHandler#get_group_id method.  Requests that have the
   * same group ID will get executed in series, in the order in which they
   * arrived in the application queue.  Requests with group ID 0 don't belong to
   * any group and will get executed independently with no serialization
   * order.
   *
   * <b>Prioritization</b>
   *
   * The ApplicationQueue supports two-level request prioritization.  Requests
   * can be designated as <i>urgent</i> which will cause them to be executed
   * before other non-urgent requests.  Urgent requests will also be executed
   * even when the ApplicationQueue has been paused.  In Hypertable, METADATA
   * scans and updates are marked urgent which allows them procede and prevent
   * deadlocks when the application queue gets paused due to low memory
   * condition in the RangeServer.  The ApplicationHandler#is_urgent
   * method is used to signal if a request is urgent.
