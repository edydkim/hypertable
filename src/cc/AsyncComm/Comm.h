     * Establishes a TCP connection and attaches a default event handler.
     * This method establishes a TCP connection to <code>addr</code>
     * and associates it with <code>default_handler</code> as the default
     * event handler for the connection.  The two types of events that
     * are delivered via the handler are CONNECTION_ESTABLISHED and DISCONNECT.
     * No ERROR events will be deliverd via the handler because any errors that
     * occur on the connection will result in the connection being closed,
     * resulting in a DISCONNECT event only.  The returned error code can be
     * inspected to determine if the handler was installed and may be
     * subsequently called back.  The following return codes indicate that
     * the default event handler was successfully associated:
     *
     *   - <code>Error::COMM_BROKEN_CONNECTION</code>
     *   - <code>Error::OK</code>
     *
     * The default event handler will be associated with the connection until
     * either a) a DISCONNECT message has been delivered to the handler, or b)
     * close_socket has been called with <code>addr</code>.  A return value
     * of <code>Error::COMM_BROKEN_CONNECTION</code> indicates that the
     * connection was broken before it was completely set up and a
     * DISCONNECT event will be promptly delivered via the default event
     * handler.  The following return codes indicate that the default event
     * handler was <b>not</b> associated with a connection and the caller
     * can assume that the call had no effect:
     *
     *   - <code>Error::COMM_ALREADY_CONNECTED</code>
     *   - <code>Error::COMM_INVALID_PROXY</code>
     *   - <code>Error::COMM_SOCKET_ERROR</code>
     *   - <code>Error::COMM_BIND_ERROR</code>
     *   - <code>Error::COMM_CONNECT_ERROR</code>
     *   - <code>Error::COMM_POLL_ERROR</code>
     *
     * The default event handler, <code>default_handler</code>, will never be
     * called back via the calling thread.  It will be called back from a
     * reactor thread.  Because reactor threads are used to service I/O
     * events on many different sockets, the default event handler should
     * return quickly from the callback.  When calling back into the default
     * event handler, the calling reactor thread does not hold any locks
     * so the default event handler callback may safely callback into the
     * Comm object (e.g. #send_response).
